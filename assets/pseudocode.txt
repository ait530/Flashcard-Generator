1. Create constructors for basic and cloze deleted flashcards.

2. basic constructor should have front and back as arguments while cloze should have text and cloze.  

3. Need to seperate the 2 types of flashcards into two seperate sets and randomize each card.

4. A 'flipCard' command that makes the CLI show the Question and then show the answer.

5. For cloze-deleted, need a 'showText' command that has the CLI show partial text (the question) and after the command, fills the rest of the text (answer).
